        "In lab 2, we have successfully built a pipeline that automatically recognizes CAPTCHAs. So far, the recognition process requires manually identifying contours (and subsequently bounding boxes) around characters using expert rules, before performing classification on extracted character images. This inspires us for possible further improvement: can we use a single neural network to directly identify CAPTCHA characters from CAPTCHA image? In this homework, we will get rid of bounding box identification and build an end-to-end neural network model.\n",
